For this funding application, a PeMS model was set for bottlenecks on both NB and SB lanes between MP340 and MP350 from January 1, 2021 to November 16, 2021. The data shows (132) incidents with one spot having average vehicle delays of 367.58 veh-hrs., 34.17 minutes in duration, with a queue of 2.35 miles on (6) separate occurrences.
When all (132) incidents were averaged, it resulted in 85.31 veh-hrs delay, 31.34 minutes duration, and an average queue extending 1.32 miles. The Reduced VHT model assumes a VMS would divert 60% of the traffic from continuing on I15, and uses averaged delays for (132) events. The time span used was (132) days to match the actual events.
