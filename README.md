# EFA-Mapping-Analyses
A repository with the primary purpose of determining Equity Focus Areas, but also for other basic mapping things.

So far, the basic mapping scripts relate to the following projects
  - Equity Focus Areas
  - Google Maps Streetview Links
  - ArcGIS Online Usage Calculation
  - Project Points for Ben in 2023

A comparison regarding different views of the Equity Focus Areas, created using 2020 data, is shown at this website: https://christopher-day.shinyapps.io/efamap/
